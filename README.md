<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aims to classify the echoes in leads and sea ice and produce an average echo shape as well as standard deviation for these two classes. For image classification K-means implementation and GMM implementation are used. Then these unsupervised methods are used for altimetry classification tasks, focusing specifically on distinguishing between sea ice and leads in Sentinel-3 altimetry dataset.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

* This project uses Google Colab to run the scripts. When using Google Colab, you will need a Google account for access to Colab and your Google drive.
* You may run the script on a different platform. Edit the file paths (directories) to properly locate your files.
* Sentinel-2 optical data, Sentinel-3 OLCI, and altimetry data are used in this project. You will need an account (username and password) to download the data from the Copernicus dataspace.

<!-- USAGE -->
## Understanding the Code: Variables and Functions


### Variables

* clusters_gmm: The clusters for each data point determined by the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). 'n_components' determines the number of components.
* flag: The initial classification flags derived from the Sentinal-3 data.
* waves: Waveform data for the observation points.
* flag_cleaned: Cleaned version of 'flag', where NaN values are removed from 'flag'.
* esa_flag_cleaned: Modified version of 'flag_cleaned' to be used for the confusion matrix. 'esa_flag_cleaned' has the true labels while 'clusters_gmm' has the predicted labels.
* waves_cleaned: Cleaned version of 'waves', where NaN values are removed from 'waves'.
* data_normalized: Standardized data containing sig_0_np (backscatter coefficient), PP_np (peakiness), and SSD_np (sum of squared differences).
* cm: Confusion matrix that compares 'esa_flag_cleaned', which has the true labels, and 'clusters_gmm', which has the predicted labels.


### Functions

In SWP_Chapter1_Unsupervised_Learning_Methods_Michel.ipynb you will find:

* **peakiness** : Calculates the peakiness of waveforms, which is a measure that compares the maximum amplitude of a waveform to its average amplitude within a specific window around the peak.

* **unpack_gpod** : Handles the unpacking and interpolation of variables from a Generic Product Output Data (GPOD) format.

* **calculate_SSD** : Calculates the Sum of Squared Differences (SSD) for a set of waveforms, which is a measure of the variance or spread of each waveform around its mean.

## Results

The tasks in this notebook will be mainly two:

* Discrimination of Sea ice and lead based on image classification based on Sentinel-2 optical data.
* Discrimination of Sea ice and lead based on altimetry data classification based on Sentinel-3 altimetry data.

<br />

Image classification based on Sentinel-2 optical data is done using both K-means clustering and GMM clustering.
Altimetry data classification based on Sentinel-3 altimetry data is done using GMM clustering.

After classifying ice and lead from the Sentinel-3 altimetry data we can produce an average echo shape and standard deviation echo shape for the two classes, ice and lead. Then a confusion matrix is produced to quantify your echo classification against the ESA official classification.

<br />

* Average Echo Shape of Ice and Lead

<br />
<br />

* Confusion Matrix for Predicted Echo Classification (GMM) and ESA Official Classification
<br />
The accuracy score, precision score, recall score, and F1 score are also printed after the confusion matrix.

</p>

<br />
<br />
<br />

We can do altimetry data classification based on Sentinel-3 altimetry data using GMM clustering for more classes instead of just two classes. In this script, GMM clustering is also done for 5 classes and 10 classes.

<br />
* Average Echo Shape of 5 Classes
